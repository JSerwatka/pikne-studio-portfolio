            A sense (Latin sensus) is the way of humans contact with the world. Thanks to the sense organs, it is
            possible to experience, perceive and receive stimuli both from the outside and inside of the body. Sensus
            also means awareness, and the ability to correctly understand and organize sensory stimuli allows us to
            expand it.

            I wanted to reflect the meaning of this word in the visual identity I created for Maria. Her goal was to
            create her own space focused on how a person functions as a whole. She shows how through external influence
            on the body we can help ourselves in many aspects of our lives.

        From the beginning of our collaboration, Aleksandra perfectly understood what I care about and what I expect,
        offering many valuable comments and ideas herself. The logo she crafted perfectly reflects the idea behind my
        company. The other materials complement it, resulting in a cohesive look of the entire project. I can highly
        recommend her services if you are looking for an exceptional, unique look for your company.
