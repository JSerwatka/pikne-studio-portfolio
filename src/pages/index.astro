            Each aspect of the design works together to create an experience similar to the soothing touch provided by
            the business owner. The visuals are carefully chosen to reflect the comforting sensations of healing hands,
            capturing the essence of a therapy session through a visual language that underscores a dedication to
            relaxation.
