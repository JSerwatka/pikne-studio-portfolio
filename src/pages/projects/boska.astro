    <Fragment slot="project-description">
        <p>
            BOSKA is a brand dedicated to the creation of exquisite body casts â€“ a fusion of elegance and timelessness
            that takes shape in sculpted beauty. The brand embraces the human form as a masterpiece, each of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            The brand works with customers in an intimate atmosphere, as creating the cast requires showing themselves
            truly as they are. Showing it as highly artistic but also reliable was a challenge I had to uptake. I
            decided to go for modern sans-serif logo and limited brand palette.
        </p>
        <p>
            A premium brand requires high attention to detail on every single touchpoint. Business cards that whisper
            luxury, boxes that carries the essence of sophistication.

            From the beginning of our collaboration, Aleksandra perfectly understood what I care about and what I
            expect, offering many valuable comments and ideas herself. The logo she crafted perfectly reflects the idea
            behind my company. The other materials complement it, resulting in a cohesive look of the entire project. I
            can highly recommend her services if you are looking for an exceptional, unique look for your company.
